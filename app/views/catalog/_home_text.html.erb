  <p>The HathiTrust US Federal Government Documents Registry is a database of metadata representing the comprehensive corpus of U.S. federal documents produced from 1789 to the present. It is not yet complete. For more detailed information on the Registry, see <a href="http://www.hathitrust.org/usgovdocs_registry">Creating a Registry of US Federal Government Documents</a>.</p>
  <p>This is not a record of what can be found in the HathiTrust Digital Library - the scope is broader and includes materials in all formats.</p>
