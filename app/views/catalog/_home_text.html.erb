  <p>This is a beta release of the HathiTrust US Federal Government Documents Registry. The Registry is intended to include item-level metadata for the comprehensive corpus of U.S. federal documents produced from 1789 to the present. For more detailed background information, see <a href="http://www.hathitrust.org/usgovdocs_registry">Creating a Registry of US Federal Government Documents</a>. This is not a record of what can be found in the <a href="http://www.hathitrust.org/home">HathiTrust Digital Library</a> - the scope is broader and includes materials in all formats.</p>
  <p>This is a work in progress and we know that there are things that still need to be worked on, but we would appreciate your feedback.</p>
